# PE4-TicTacToe
Part 2 of PE4 CSCI3010

Person 1 - Myles Hansen
Person 2 - Nick Cervasio

Our program creates a rudimentary TicTacToe Board that accepts user input
and updates the board based on player choice.

It is assumed that each individual is playing fair and a winner is not 
automatically checked for.
